# CloudKlone - Text Cleanup 📝

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Audit Logs Section
**Before:**
```
Audit Logs
Activity history for transparency and accountability
```

**After:**
```
Audit Logs
```

**Why:** Removed AI-sounding corporate speak. The title says it all.

### 2. Transfers Section
**Before:**
```
Transfers
Create and monitor cloud-to-cloud transfers
```

**After:**
```
Transfers
Create and monitor cloud and local transfers
```

**Why:** More accurate - CloudKlone supports local file transfers too, not just cloud-to-cloud.
